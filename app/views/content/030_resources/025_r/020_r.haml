%h1 The R (For Resources) Class

:markdown

  R is the class that you use when you want to access a resource form within Java.

  The R class is an automatically generated class that contains pointers to all of your resource files. Every layout, button, string, image, mp3 etc found in the res folder (or any XML file within it) is represented by the R class.

  ## The R class:

  * Is automatically generated whenever you compile. Don't bother editing it.
  * Contains pointers to any UI elements, Strings, images, boxes full of cats, etc. that we might have sitting in the resources folder.
  * Can be used to get access to these elements in our Java.

  ## Here's an example of an R class:


:ruby
  code = <<-CODE

    /* AUTO-GENERATED FILE.  DO NOT MODIFY.
     *
     * This class was automatically generated by the
     * aapt tool from the resource data it found.  It
     * should not be modified by hand.
     */

    package ly.trivial.HelloWorld;

    public final class R {
        public static final class attr {
        }
        public static final class drawable {
            public static final int box=0x7f020000;
            public static final int ic_launcher=0x7f020001;
        }
        public static final class id {
            public static final int editCatCount=0x7f050003;
            public static final int imageView1=0x7f050005;
            public static final int submitCatCountButton=0x7f050004;
            public static final int textView1=0x7f050002;
        }
        public static final class layout {
            public static final int how_many_cats=0x7f030001;
        }
        public static final class string {
            public static final int app_name=0x7f040001;
            public static final int button_check=0x7f040004;
            public static final int question=0x7f040002;
        }
    }

  The R class contains a bunch of inner classes, each of which contains pointers to the resources.

  We can access the submit button using:


:ruby
  code = <<-CODE
    R.id.submitCatCountButton
